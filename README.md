# blessclient

**Please note**: If you believe you have found a security issue, _please responsibly disclose_ by contacting us at [security@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:security@chanzuckerberg.com).

----

Inspiration for this project comes from [lyft/python-blessclient](https://github.com/lyft/python-blessclient).
We decided to write in Go because it is much easier to distribute a statically linked binary to a large team than having to deal with python environments. Some features from [lyft/python-blessclient](https://github.com/lyft/python-blessclient) are currently missing but will be added over time while others are purposefully excluded.

## Install

### Mac

You can use homebrew -

```
brew tap chanzuckerberg/tap
brew install blessclient
```

### Linux, Windows, etc...
Binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/blessclient/releases) page. Download one for your architecture, put it in your path and make it executable.

## Usage

At a high level:
1. [Install](#install) blessclient
1. If you don't have an SSH key, generate one with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
1. [Import](#import-config) or [generate](#init) a blessclient config
1. Run `blessclient run` and make sure there are no errors
1. Modify your [ssh config](#sshconfig) to be bless compatible
1. ssh, scp, rsync as you normally would

### Config

By default, `blessclient` looks for configs in `~/.blessclient/config.yml`. You can always override this `blessclient run -c /my/new/config.yml`
Some more information on the config can be found [here](pkg/config/config.go).

There are two built-in methods to facilitate the generation of blessclient configs:

#### Init

`blessclient init` will ask you some questions in order to assemble some basic configuration.

#### Import-config
Alternatively, you can also use pre-generated config files.

A few options here:
`blessclient import-config git@github.com:/..../teamA/blessconfig.yml`
`blessclient import-config https://www.github.com/..../teamA/blessconfig.yml`
`blessclient import-config /home/user/.../teamA/blessconfig.yml`
`blessclient import-config s3::https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/teamA/blessconfig.yml`

This command uses [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter) to fetch a config and thus supports any source that [go-getter](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#supported-protocols-and-detectors) supports.

### .ssh/config

This is the nice part about blessclient - in general, you can write an ssh config to transparently use blessclient. scp, rsync, etc should all be compatible!

Such an ssh config could look like:

```
Match OriginalHost bastion.foo.com exec "blessclient run"
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host 10.0.*
  ProxyJump bastion.foo.com
  User czi-admin

Host bastion.foo.com
  User czi-admin
```

This ssh config does a couple of interesting things -

- It transparently requests an ssh certificate if needed
- It transparently does a ProxyJump through a bastion host (assuming 10.0.* is an ipblock for machines behind the bastion)

## Telemetry
There currently is some basic trace instrumentation using [honeycomb](https://www.honeycomb.io/). We use this internally to track usage, gather performance statistics, and error reporting. Telemetry is disabled without a honeycomb write key - which you must provide through the [config](pkg/config/config.go).

## Common Errors

### Unsafe RSA public key
Bless lambda is rejecting your key because because it is not cryptographically sound. You can generate a new key `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` and use that instead.
