Release v0.2.0 (2018-09-12)
===

This is the second major release of the beeline. It changes the model from "one
current span" to a to a doubly-linked tree of events (now dubbed "spans")
representing a trace.

### Major Changes

* introduces the concept of a span
* adds functions to create new spans in a trace and add fields to specific spans
* adds the ability to create and accept a serialized chunk of data from an upstream service to connect in-process traces in a distributed infrastructure into one large trace.
* adds trace level fields that get copied to every downstream span
* adds rollup fields that sum their values and push them in to the root span
* adds a pre-send hook to modify spans before sending them to Honeycomb
* adds trace-aware deterministic sampling as the default
* adds a sampler hook to manually manage sampling if necessary

### Breaking Changes

* removed `ContextEvent` and `ContextWithEvent` functions; replaced by spans

### Wrapper Changes
* augment the net/http wrapper to wrap `RoundTripper`s and handle outbound HTTP calls
* adding a wrapper for the `pop` package
